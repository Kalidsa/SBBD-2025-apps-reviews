A Data Augmentation and Validation Pipeline for Improving
Emotion Classification in Mobile App Reviews


# Abstract.
This paper investigates the impact of using data augmentation techniques based on generative language models, such as GPT-2, in improving sentiment classification in mobile app reviews written in Portuguese. Using the
BERTimbau model as the main classifier, the work proposes a pipeline that
combines synthetic data generation with semantic analysis, dimensionality reduction with UMAP, and clustering with HDBSCAN for validation and filtering
of the generated data. The results indicate that synthetic augmentation, when
properly validated and balanced, contributes to the modelâ€™s performance in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced data.
